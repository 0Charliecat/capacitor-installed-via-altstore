A simple plugin to read a string from Info.plist on iOS and strings.xml on Android

## Supported platforms

- iOS

Trying to find out if my theory about altstore putting someting with `Alt` to `Info.plist` checks out

Anyways, looks like apps installed with altstore also have url scheme of `altstore-<bundle id>://`
